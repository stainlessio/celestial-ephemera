# Celestial Ephemera

## Synopsis
A system to visualize the unseen ephemera of the digital world.  By utilizing BTLE technology, we can eavesdrop on this unseen world, and bring it to the forefront of our attention.

## Concept
We are surrounded by man-made invisible forces in the form of radio waves.  Never in any time of history have humans subjected themselves to the level of EMF to which we as a species are subjecting ourselves.  From radio stations to bluetooth, the density at which we are surrounded is staggering.

This project focuses on a single technology: BTLE advertisements.  From these simple packets, we can learn a load of information about the devices, the radio power, what services are available on the device, and the name.

The visualization also models the market forces at play with this devices.  Apple and Android devices repel each other.  Fitness devices are attracted to each other, and all are repelled by iBeacons use for advertising.

Each device is represented by a unique shape based on their Device ID, generated so that similar devices look similar, while different brands look radically different adding complexity to the simulation.
